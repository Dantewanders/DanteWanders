### 👋 Who I Am

I build clean, conversion-focused web experiences for service-based businesses — from mental health practices to moving companies and tourism brands.  

My background in sales, branding, and digital media gives me an unfair advantage: I don’t just ship code, I ship **systems that actually move revenue**. Every project aims for the same three things:

> **Creativity. Precision. Impact.**

### 💡 A Bit About Me

I'm a builder at heart. I like taking messy ideas, structuring them, designing them, and shipping them — fast.  

Between full-stack development, content creation, and digital strategy at **Trident Media Management**, I live where tech, storytelling, and business results overlap.  

If you're here to explore my work, steal ideas, or talk about leveling up your brand’s digital presence — you’re in the right place.
